	<h2>Step One</h2>
    <p>Determine the niche market you're trying to reach. Do you sell treats and goods to a wide variety of animals? Do you offer hands-on training or grooming services for dogs? </p>
    <h2>Step Two</h2>
    <p>Develop a flier that highlights your key services. Make clear the things that set you apart from other pet stores in your area. </p>
  	<h2>Step Three</h2>
    <p>Place an ad in your local newspaper or on a local radio station. Again, highlight the qualities that set you apart from other pet stores. </p>
    <h2>Step Four</h2>
	<p>Host an in-store event for area pet owners. You can give away a basket of pet goodies and offer to donate a portion of proceeds from sales to a local animal shelter. Offer snacks and games, and invite local newspapers, radio and television stations to come.</p>
